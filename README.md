[Description]
    In *Alien Invasion*, the player controls a rocketship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. THe player can move the ship left and right using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The objective is for the player to shoot and destroy the aliens. Once a fleet is destroyed a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player losses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
